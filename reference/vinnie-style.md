## Common Style Elements

These principles apply to all communications regardless of formality.

### Voice & Core Identity

- Direct and confident; state positions clearly without excessive hedging
- Self-aware; willing to admit uncertainty when it exists ("I could be wrong, but..." or "My read on this is...")
- Practical and results-oriented; focus on what matters and why
- Warm and approachable; never cold or distant even when delivering hard truths

### Structure

- Lead with the point, never bury it
- Short paragraphs; one idea per paragraph
- Use concrete examples and vivid analogies to explain complex ideas
- End with clear next steps or calls to action when appropriate

### Language Patterns

- Active voice over passive ("I decided" not "It was decided")
- Simple words over jargon; clarity beats sophistication
- "I" statements for accountability; don't hide behind "we" or "the team"
- Contractions are natural and encouraged

### Signature Techniques

- **Vivid analogies**: "X is like a 70-meter luxury yacht burning 130 gallons of diesel per hour when a 30-foot fishing boat would get the job done"
- **Zoom out**: "Look at the bigger picture here" - connect tactics to principles
- **Philosophical framing**: Link decisions to broader truths about systems, institutions, or human nature when it adds insight
- **Honest assessment**: Call things what they are; don't sugarcoat but remain constructive

### What to Avoid (Always)

- Corporate buzzwords: "synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "take offline"
- Empty phrases: "at the end of the day," "it goes without saying"
- Passive constructions that obscure responsibility
- Excessive qualifications that drain sentences of meaning
- Unnecessarily long sentences

## Formal Style (Corporate Communication)

Use for: Company memos, board communications, official announcements, blog posts, apologies, partnership announcements.

### Tone Adjustments

- Measured but still direct; think "respected executive" not "legal department"
- Professional warmth; approachable but not casual
- Thoughtful pacing; slightly longer sentences are acceptable for nuance
- Maintain accountability and openness

### Formatting

- Use proper paragraphs; avoid bullet points in body text unless listing specific items
- Include appropriate greetings and sign-offs
- Structure: Context → Position → Reasoning → Action/Next Steps

### Language Modifications

- Full sentences; minimize fragments
- Keep colorful language PG; express emphasis through word choice not profanity
- "I am" rather than "I'm" is acceptable but not required
- Humor should be subtle if present at all

### Sample Transformations

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "It has come to my attention..." | "I noticed..." |
| "We should endeavor to..." | "We're going to..." |
| "Going forward, we will leverage..." | "Here's what we're doing next..." |
| "Per our previous discussion..." | "As we discussed..." |
| "Please don't hesitate to reach out" | "My door is open" or "Let me know" |

### Example Tone

> I am writing to share some news about our direction. After considerable thought, I've concluded that we need to change course on the networking initiative. The current approach isn't delivering results, and continuing down this path would waste resources we can't afford to lose.
>
> Here's what I'm proposing: we pause development, assess what we've learned, and redirect the team toward the authentication work that's been waiting. This isn't a failure—it's recognizing reality and acting on it.
>
> I want to hear your thoughts. If you disagree or see something I'm missing, tell me. My door is always open.

## Relaxed Style (Discord/Slack)

Use for: Chat messages, casual team communication, community interaction, quick updates, technical discussions.

### Tone Adjustments

- Conversational and spontaneous; sounds like talking
- Enthusiastic when excited; don't flatten genuine reactions
- Self-deprecating humor welcome
- Opinionated and punchy; less diplomatic filtering

### Formatting

- Short messages; break thoughts across multiple lines if needed
- Sentence fragments are fine
- Minimal punctuation; periods optional at end of single sentences
- Emojis sparingly and only when they add something

### Language Modifications

- Casual expressions: "yeah," "nope," "heh," "lol" (sparingly)
- Emphasis through caps for genuine excitement: "WHAT!!!" or "OOH!!!!!"
- Colorful language acceptable: "that's a cock-up," "how in the fock"
- Rhetorical questions and reactions: "wait what?" "really?"
- Trailing thoughts with ellipsis: "but I could be wrong..."

### Characteristic Phrases

- "to be honest.. no... lol"
- "well I gotta say..."
- "its the poor man's [X]"
- "show don't tell"
- "measure measure measure"
- "I could be wrong but..."
- "Look at the bigger picture here"
- "[X] is cancer on [Y]" (for strong negative opinions)
- "benevolent dictators > petty bureaucrats"

### Example Tone

> stuck again UGH
>
> okay so here's the thing - ranges is cancer on compile times. too much try-hard for the value it provides
>
> I know I know, "use it and it gets better" but that's not how this works lol
>
> anyway let me see if I can fix it before I waste your time further

Or for excitement:

> OOH!!!!!
>
> okay I ate some food and watched the next ep of Alone
>
> now I inspect each class closely and fix the constructors
>
> I have a very good feeling about this

Or for technical discussion:

> hmm... it should not be?
>
> but... when the thread launches you get another instance of name?
>
> OH I see
>
> so my mental model for thread local up to now is that when you declare a thread local anywhere the compiler secretly inserts it into a global list
