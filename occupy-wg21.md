**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Occupy WG21 Launches to Address C++ Standards Committee Dysfunction

*Grassroots coalition demands accountability, safety focus, and community-driven standardization*

**January 2026** — A coalition of C++ developers, library authors, and industry practitioners today announced the formation of **Occupy WG21**, an advocacy group dedicated to reforming the ISO C++ Standards Committee (WG21).

The group forms amid growing concern that the committee has become institutionally sclerotic—shipping features developers don't want while failing to deliver the improvements they need. As external pressure mounts over C++ memory safety and the language faces existential competition from Rust and other modern alternatives, Occupy WG21 argues the committee's current structure is fundamentally unable to respond.

"WG21 is no longer serving the needs of the wider C++ community," said the coalition in a joint statement. "The three-year release cycle ships half-baked features. The proliferation of study groups and evolution working groups has created bureaucratic gridlock. Meanwhile, the standard library accumulates components that don't belong there while critical infrastructure remains unaddressed."

The group emphasizes it does not seek to control WG21 directly, but rather to represent the voice of the broader C++ ecosystem—the millions of developers, the corporations shipping production code, and the open-source maintainers who bear the consequences of committee decisions.

Occupy WG21 has released a five-point manifesto outlining structural reforms it believes are necessary for C++ to remain viable in the coming decades.

# THE OCCUPY WG21 MANIFESTO

## Five Planks for C++ Standardization Reform

### I. Abolish Evolution Working Groups

Return to the original two-group structure: **Core** and **Library**.

The evolution working groups (EWG, LEWG) have become gatekeeping bureaucracies that add process without adding value. Papers spend years bouncing between groups, wordsmithed to death while their technical merit goes unexamined. The original structure worked. Restore it.

### II. Eliminate Study Groups

No more study groups.

What we need are *experts*—people who read the papers carefully and evaluate them on technical merit. Study groups have become holding pens where proposals go to die, or worse, echo chambers that advance pet projects without sufficient scrutiny. Expertise, not committee proliferation.

### III. Six-Year Release Cycles

Abandon the three-year release cadence. Adopt a **six-year cycle**:

- **Years 1–3:** Development phase. New papers accepted, features designed and approved.
- **Years 4–6:** Implementation and stabilization. Feature freeze. Compiler vendors implement. The community discovers what works and what doesn't. Defects are fixed. Library components mature.

The current three-year cycle ships features before anyone knows if they work. Compiler support lags years behind. Users can't rely on "standard" features actually being available. This is not standardization—it's aspirational documentation.

### IV. Alternating Major/Minor Releases

Within the six-year framework, maintain a **three-year heartbeat** for defect resolution:

- **Major releases** (every 6 years): New features, language evolution
- **Minor releases** (interleaved): Bug fixes and defect reports only

This provides stability for production users while maintaining a path for critical corrections.

### V. Constrain the Standard Library

Stop adding components that don't need to be there.

The standard library is not a showcase for interesting ideas. It is foundational infrastructure that every C++ implementation must support, forever. Each addition carries permanent maintenance burden and constrains future evolution.

WG21 must develop clear criteria for what belongs in the standard library versus what belongs in the ecosystem. The bar for inclusion must be raised dramatically.

## Our Position

We do not expect to change WG21 from within. The committee is an institution with its own inertia, its own power structures, its own incentives. We accept this.

What we can change is everything else: the media narrative, the expectations of employers, the choices of developers, the procurement decisions of corporations. We can make the costs of institutional dysfunction visible. We can articulate what the C++ community actually needs and hold the committee accountable when it fails to deliver.

WG21 has operated without meaningful external accountability for decades. That ends now.

**Join us.**
