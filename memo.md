# AI Integration – Our Path Forward

I want to share our strategy for the next phase of The C++ Alliance. We're making a significant transition, and I need everyone on board.

Luis has procured enterprise accounts for Cursor and Claude. I want every single person here taking full advantage of these tools starting now.

Here's my position: AI and large language models are genuinely useful, but they require skill to wield effectively. The core competency you need to develop is evaluation—looking at AI output and knowing what's good, what's garbage, and how to steer it with better prompts. You need to become prompt engineers.

Anyone who doesn't build this skill will fall behind, and that's true whether you stay here or go somewhere else. The software industry has fundamentally changed.

I don't want anyone wasting time on tasks AI can handle. It's excellent at mechanical work:

- Converting HTML documentation to AsciiDoc? Done in seconds without errors.
- Complex refactorings across a codebase? No problem.
- Migrating to newer C++ standards? It handles it.
- Converting template metaprogramming to concepts? It can do that too.

The list goes on.

Look at what we've already accomplished with this approach:

- **Clang Compiler Project** – AI-guided patches for upstream contribution
- **Corosio** – A replacement for Boost.Asio
- **Boost.Capy** – An alternative to std::execution
- **Beast2** – Next generation HTTP library
- **Burl** – High-level HTTP client

Ideas that would have taken years are materializing in months because we're leveraging this technology.

Think of this as training for the next generation of software development. Learn what AI can do for your personal workflow. You don't need to change how you work—you need to make yourself more effective. AI is how you do that.

I'm tasking everyone with being open-minded and exploring what these tools can do for you. If we want to remain effective in the C++ ecosystem, we have to take advantage of what's available to us.

My door is open if you want to discuss this further.
